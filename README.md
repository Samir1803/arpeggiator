## Features

- **Hand-Controlled Arpeggiator**: Create complex musical patterns with simple hand gestures.
- **Drum Machine**: Tap into a variety of drum sounds to enhance your musical creations.
- **Audio-Reactive Visualizer**: Watch your music come to life with stunning visual effects that react to the sound.
- **Augmented Reality**: Experience music in a new dimension with AR integration.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on various devices, making it accessible for everyone.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several powerful libraries and frameworks:

- **MediaPipe**: For hand gesture recognition and tracking.
- **Three.js**: To create immersive 3D visualizations.
- **Tone.js**: For generating and manipulating audio in real-time.

## Installation

To get started with the Arpeggiator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samir1803/arpeggiator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd arpeggiator
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   Run the following command to launch the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open in Browser**:
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to start using the Arpeggiator.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, follow these steps to start creating music:

1. **Hand Positioning**: Position your hands in front of the camera. The application uses MediaPipe to detect your hand gestures.
2. **Select Instruments**: Use hand gestures to switch between different instruments and sounds.
3. **Create Patterns**: Move your hands to create arpeggios or trigger drum sounds.
4. **Visualize**: Watch the audio-reactive visualizer respond to your music in real-time.

## How It Works

### Hand Gesture Recognition

The application uses MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities to recognize various gestures. These gestures correspond to different musical functions:

- **Open Hand**: Start or stop the arpeggiator.
- **Fist**: Trigger drum sounds.
- **Finger Pointing**: Change the current instrument.

### Audio Generation

Tone.js handles the audio synthesis, allowing for real-time manipulation of sound. You can create complex musical patterns by layering sounds and adjusting parameters like pitch and tempo.

### Visual Feedback

Three.js creates a dynamic visual experience that reacts to the audio output. The visuals change based on the intensity and frequency of the sound, providing an engaging experience.
